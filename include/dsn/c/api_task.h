 callback prototype for task cancellation (called on task-being-cancelled)

 in rDSN, tasks can be cancelled. For languages such as C++, when there are explicit resource
 release operations (e.g., ::free, release_ref()) in the task handlers, cancellation will
 cause resource leak due to not-executed task handleers. in order to support such scenario,
 rDSN provides dsn_task_cancelled_handler_t which is executed when a task is cancelled. Note
 this callback does not have thread affinity similar to task handlers above (which are
 configured to be executed in certain thread pools or even a fixed thread). Therefore, it is
 developers' resposibility to ensure this cancallation callback only does thread-insensitive
 operations (e.g., release_ref()).
