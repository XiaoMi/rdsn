# Case Description:
# - test sending downgrade_to_secondary/downgrade_to_inactive/remove to secondary
# - test sending upgrade_to_primary to secondary
# - test sending add_secondary to node

set:load_balance_for_test=1,not_exit_on_log_failure=1

# wait for server ready
config:{3,r1,[r2,r3]}
state:{{r1,pri,3,0},{r2,sec,3,0},{r3,sec,3,0}}

# downgrade the primary r1 to inactive,
# and disable lb so we can test the config commands below
client:replica_config:receiver=r1,type=downgrade_to_inactive,node=r1
set:disable_load_balance=1

state:{{r1,ina,4,0},{r2,sec,3,0},{r3,sec,3,0}}

# all these command will be ignored
client:replica_config:receiver=r2,type=downgrade_to_secondary,node=r3
client:replica_config:receiver=r2,type=downgrade_to_inactive,node=r3
client:replica_config:receiver=r2,type=remove,node=r3

# then upgrade r3 to primary
client:replica_config:receiver=r3,type=upgrade_to_primary,node=r3
config:{5,r3,[r2]}

# then enable load balance, and the state will be normal again
client:replica_config:receiver=r3,type=add_secondary,node=r1
config:{6,r3,[r1,r2]}
