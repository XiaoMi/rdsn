# Case Description:
# - trigger meta-server to call downgrade_to_inactive
# - trigger meta-server to call remove
# - trigger meta-server to call downgrade_to_secondary

set:load_balance_for_test=1,not_exit_on_log_failure=1

# wait for server ready
config:{3,r1,[r2,r3]}
state:{{r1,pri,3,0},{r2,sec,3,0},{r3,sec,3,0}}

# we test the downgrade r2 to inactive
client:replica_config:receiver=r1,type=downgrade_to_inactive,node=r2

# after downgrade, r2 will be inactive
config:{4,r1,[r3]}

# and lb will reassign the r2 be be a secondary
config:{5,r1,[r2,r3]}
state:{{r1,pri,5,0},{r2,sec,5,0},{r3,sec,5,0}}

# and we test the remove r3
client:replica_config:receiver=r1,type=remove,node=r3

# the secondary is removed from meta server
config:{6,r1,[r2]}

# and in the end lb will assign an sec again
config:{7,r1,[r2,r3]}
state:{{r1,pri,7,0},{r2,sec,7,0},{r3,sec,7,0}}

# then test downgrade r1 to secondary
client:replica_config:receiver=r1,type=downgrade_to_secondary,node=r1
