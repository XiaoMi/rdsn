# - inject update_partition_configuration

set:load_balance_for_test=1,not_exit_on_log_failure=1

# initial config
config:{0,-,[]}

# start to do load balance
# inject assign_primary proposal to r1

# meta will restart load balance,
# and assign primary to r1 again

# inject update_partition_configuration (timeout is 5 seconds)

# r1 start to do config_sync (config_sync_interval_ms=4000)
